Hello, this is a school 21 project.

Implementation of the string.h library in c. I personally did the sscanf function.

To check, download and write “make” in cmd. You will see gcov_report. If you want to test your examples, you can create the library by typing "make s21_string.a". The library name will be s21_string.a. You can use this flag "-L. s21_string.a" when compiling your main.
